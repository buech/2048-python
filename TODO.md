Todo
====

- caching (with a dict and hasing grids)
- evaluation-function tuning
- port search algorithm to `Fortran` and use `f2py`
- put algorithms into classes
- reimplement some stuff from logic for performance
- write benchmark script (possibly using `parallel`) that runs algorithms multiple times and extracts metrics in a nice way to plot and average them
